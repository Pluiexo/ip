### Specification for `[DateTimeFormat]`

It comes in two parts `[DateFormats]` and `[TimeFormats]`.
`[TimeFormats]` can be omitted and Plato will assume the time to be midnight of that particular day.

The order of the `[DateFormats]` and `[TimeFormats]` does not matter as long as a space between them to differentiate the two

> If your [DateTimeFormat] is invalid, Plato will store them as normal strings instead ,this is to support a wider variety fo users,
> this will affect the Query:view command later

Usage:
```
[DateFormats]
[DateFormats] [TimeFormats]
[TimeFormats] [DateFormats]
```

Examples :
```
12-04-24 1800
03:30pm 15/03/2024

```

Current acceptable **[DateFormats]** are :
```
dd-mm-yy
dd/mm/yy
dd-mm-yyyy
dd/mm/yyyy
```

> [!NOTE]
> If the year used is 2 digits, Plato will assume the year in the current millennium

Current acceptable **[TimeFormats]** in 12 or 24 hour formats are allowed as follows:
```
HHMM
HH:MM
HH:MM[am/pm]
```
> [!CAUTION]
> Time written in 12-hour format requires specifying am/pm. Otherwise, Plato will assume 24-hour format.
